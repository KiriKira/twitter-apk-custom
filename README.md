# Twitter/X & Instagram APK (Piko Patches) - Local Builder

[![Stable Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/monsivamon/twitter-apk?label=Stable&color=success)](https://github.com/monsivamon/twitter-apk/releases/latest)
[![Pre-Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/monsivamon/twitter-apk?include_prereleases&label=Pre-Release&color=orange)](https://github.com/monsivamon/twitter-apk/releases)

A Python-based local build system for applying [Piko](https://github.com/crimera/piko) patches to Twitter/X and Instagram. 
Due to upstream tooling changes and stability requirements, this project has transitioned from an automated CI pipeline to a **reliable manual/local builder**.

## 📦 About Releases
APKs available on the Releases page of this repository are manually updated and uploaded by the author (monsivamon) by running `main_manual.py` on their local machine. Automated updates via GitHub Actions (CI) are currently suspended.

## 🛠️ How to Build Locally (and Upload to Your Repo)

If you want to apply patches and build on your own local machine, and **upload the release to your own repository**, please follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites
* **Windows OS** (This script is intended and optimized for Windows environments).
* **Python 3.x** installed.
* **Java (JDK 17 or 21)** installed and added to your system's `PATH`.
* **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`) with **your own account**.
* A valid **PKCS12 format** keystore file named **`ks_pkcs12.keystore`** placed in the root directory.
* **`apksigner`** (from Android SDK Build-Tools) installed and accessible in your `PATH` (used for reliably signing massive APKs like Instagram).

### ⚠️ Important Note (Script Modification)
Even if you are authenticated with the GitHub CLI, if the repository settings in the script remain as `monsivamon/twitter-apk`, the release upload will fail with a permission error.
**Before running the build, you MUST change the repository name in `main_manual.py` (e.g., `GITHUB_REPO = "monsivamon/twitter-apk"`) to your own repository name.**

### Usage
1. Fork this repository to your own account, or clone it locally.
2. **Modify the repository settings in the script to your own, as described in the "Important Note" above.** *(Change `GITHUB_REPO = "monsivamon/twitter-apk"`)*
3. Create a folder named `.base_apk` in the root directory.
4. Place your unpatched Twitter/X or Instagram APKs (or `.apkm` bundles) inside the `.base_apk` folder.
5. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run the builder script:

```cmd
python main_manual.py
```

6. **Choose your desired execution mode from the interactive menu (e.g., `[1] Full Build`, `[4] Upload Only`).**
7. Choose your target branch (Stable/Pre-release) when prompted. The script will automatically handle merging, shim application (if necessary), patching, signing (using `apksigner` and your `ks_pkcs12.keystore`), and creating/uploading the release to your own repository.
